# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Python Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Tool

A lightweight Python script designed to perform ARP poisoning-based Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks on local networks. This tool enables interception and analysis of network traffic between a target device and the gateway.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **ARP Poisoning**: Redirects traffic between a specified target and gateway.
- **MAC Address Resolution**: Utilizes the `manuf` library to identify device manufacturers.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Offers flexible options for specifying targets and gateways.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hvns1414/mitm-man-in-the-middle-.git
   cd mitm-man-in-the-middle-
Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Then, install the required Python packages:

Kopyala
D√ºzenle
pip install scapy manuf
üöÄ Usage
Run the script with the appropriate options:

bash
Kopyala
D√ºzenle
python mitm.py -g <gateway_ip> -t <target_ip>
Options:

-g, --gateway: IP address of the network gateway.

-t, --target: IP address of the target device.

Example:

bash
Kopyala
D√ºzenle
python mitm.py -g 192.168.1.1 -t 192.168.1.100
This command initiates an ARP poisoning attack between the specified gateway and target.
